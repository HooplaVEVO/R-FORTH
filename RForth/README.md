This is my implementation of FORTH in C, called RAMBLER FORTH

Currently working features:

- REPL Environment
- All stack operations (dup, swap, drop, etc.)
- Math operations
- Simple conditional expressions (=, <, >)

Coming Soon:

- Piping output with '.'
- Support for variables and constants
- Advanced conditional expressions
- If-else loops
- Custom function support
